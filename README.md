# PIA - A Concept for a Personal Information Assistant for Data Analysis and Machine Learning in industrial application

# About
PIA is a concept for a personal information assistant for data analysis and machine learning in industrial application. It has been first introduced on the NFDI4Ing Conference 2022 (https://zenodo.org/record/7362038/files/798_PIA-A_concept_for_a_personal_Information_Assistant_for_Data_Analysis.pdf?download=1).\
The corresponding journal paper with detailed explaination has been submitted to the journal Ing.grid.

The concept has been developed as part of a cooperation between the Lab for Measurement Technology and the Chair of Assembly Systems within the framework of the ERDF project "Messtechnisch gestützte Montage" and the follow-up project" "iTecPro – Erforschung und Entwicklung von innovativen Prozessen und Technologien für die Produktion der Zukunft". Future development is carried out in the project "NFDI4Ing – the National Research Data Infrastructure for Engineering Sciences", funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – 442146713.

Developers:
Christopher Schnur, Tanja Dorst, Steffen Klein, Anne Blum, Kapil Deshmukh, Sarah Zimmer, Philipp Litzenburger, Tizian Schneider, Lennard Margies, Dr. Leonie Mende, Prof. Dr. Rainer Müller and Prof. Dr. Andreas Schütze.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.4.

## Optional: Setting up a virtual environment
Install a virtual environment like VMWare or Virtual Box with 30 GB storage (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).\
Install ubuntu (Preferably the latest LTS version https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).\
Install vs code or any editor you prefer.

## Installing the necessary environment for development
Install node js: `sudo apt install nodejs`\
Install node package manager: `sudo apt install npm`\
Install Angular Cli: `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Clone the repository
Clone this git repository to you machine with the `git clone`

## Installing necessary dependencies
Navigate to the root folder of the project and run the command `npm install`, this will install all the dependencies from the package.json file.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
